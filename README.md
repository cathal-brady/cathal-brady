# 🌟 Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

> I'm a data scientist and ML enthusiast passionate about deep tech, climate change, and industry challenges.

## 🧠 About Me

I originally come from a quantitative economics and finance background, but I've been working on data science and machine learning projects for the last few years. I'm in my final year of the X/HEC Data Science and AI for Business 2-year master's program, and I've had the opportunity to work in both Ireland 🇮🇪 and France 🇫🇷.

## 🔍 Areas of Interest

- 🤖 Deep tech and AI/ML applications
- 💼 Solving industry challenges with data science
- 🌍 Climate change and sustainability (particularly interested in forestry)

## 🚀 Recent Projects

- 🫀 [Predicting Oncologic Structures](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/150): Few shot learning of anatomical and oncological structures in CT images (Challenge hosted by Raidium) 
- 🌳 [Forest Change Detection](https://swiftt.eu/): I worked on this EU-funded project during my time at Axa Climate. Code is private but mainly uses Google Earth Engine in combination with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
- 💵 [Project C](https://github.com/cathal-brady/Paris_Bike_Traffic_Prediction): Using a spatial dataset of bike counters around Paris, combined with weather and traffic data, to build a machine learning model that predicts bike traffic.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate!

I'm always on the lookout for exciting research projects, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any ideas or opportunities. I'd love to connect and explore ways we can work together.

When I'm not immersed in data science and machine learning, you can find me indulging in two of my favorite pastimes: fishing 🎣 and restoring vintage items 🔧🪚
